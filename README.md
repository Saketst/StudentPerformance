## End to End Machine Learning Project

In this project, I developed an end-to-end machine learning solution to predict student performance using a publicly available dataset. The goal of the project was to create a model that could accurately predict student performance based on various demographic and academic factors.

To achieve this, I first performed data preprocessing and cleaning steps, including handling missing values, removing duplicates, and encoding categorical variables. I then used various feature engineering techniques such as normalization, scaling, and feature selection to create a dataset that was optimized for machine learning algorithms.

I then used various supervised machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, decision tree, random forest and many more to train and test the model. I also performed hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model for accuracy and performance.

Finally, I deployed the model using Flask and created a web application where users can input student data and receive a predicted performance score. The project resulted in r2_score of 87% and has the potential to improve student performance predictions, allowing for better decision-making by educators and administrators.

Throughout the project, I utilized Python, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Flask, and other tools and frameworks to create an end-to-end machine learning solution. The project helped me develop skills in data preprocessing, feature engineering, machine learning algorithms, and deployment, and demonstrated my ability to deliver results that can have a real-world impact.
